## Project Requirements & Prerequisites

1. IDE of Choice
2. Python3
3. Browser

* Please ensure you're working from a Windows/MacOS/Linux
* Install Flask through `pip install flask`

## Project Setup and Installation

1. Proceed to this [link](https://github.com/kelvinmburu/pitch-minute.git) and clone the repository.
2. Extract the folder and `cd` to the folder on your terminal or your prefered IDE
3. In the terminal, create a virtual/flask environment: `python3 -m venv virtual` and activate it through `source virtual/bin/activate`. In the case of flask, please use `source flask/bin/activate` or refer to this [documentation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31252791/flask-importerror-no-module-named-flask) for Flask virtual environment installation.
4. Install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file; use `pip` to install needed dependencies.
5. In the project folder, create a `start.sh` file which acts as a server at runtime.
6. In the terminal, and within the project folder, run `chmod +x start.sh` and `./start.sh` to start the project.
7. View the application on your browser on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. If you have another project running on another port, use `flask run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001` to switch to a new port; You can use a different port number.

## Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

The BDD focuses on how a user interacts with the application.

At a minimum, this is what the user should experience in the application:

* A user can see the pitches other people have posted.
* A user can vote on the pitch they liked and give it a downvote or upvote.
* The app allows a user to view the pitches they have created in their profile page.
* A user can submit a pitch in any category and view the different categories.
* A user can comment on the different pitches and leave feedback.
* The app sends a welcoming email once they sign up.
